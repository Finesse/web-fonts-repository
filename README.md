A simple webfont hosting inspired by [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com).
It runs on your server, stores and distributes webfont files and generates CSS on-the-go for embedding fonts on web pages.


## Quick start

### Requirements

1. HTTP server supporting PHP â‰¥ 7.0
2. [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) (required for installation)

### Installation

#### 1. Download the source code

Run the following code in the console:

```bash
composer create-project finesse/web-fonts-repository webfonts
```

Where `webfonts` is a path to a directory where the repository should be installed.

Or you can make some things manually:

1. Download [the source code from GitHub](http://github.com/Finesse/web-fonts-repository/archive/master.zip) and extract it.
2. Open a terminal and go to the source code root.
3. Install the libraries by running in the terminal:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
4. Prepare the repository by running in the terminal:
    ```bash
    composer run-script post-create-project-cmd
    ```

#### 2. File permissions

Give the user behalf which the web server runs permissions to write inside the `logs` directory.

You can just run this in the console:

```bash
# Don't do it in production!
chmod 777 logs
```

#### 3. Web server

Make the directory `public` be the document root of the web server.
Or just open [http://localhost/public](http://localhost/public) if you installed the repository to the web server root.

Make all the requests to not-existing files be handled by `public/index.php`. 
If your server is Apache, it's already done.

Make the server add the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` HTTP-header to the font files. 
Otherwise some browsers will reject using fonts from the repository.
* Apache: all you need to do is to make sure that the `mod_header.c` module is on
  (run the `a2enmod headers` command and restart the server to turn it on).
* Nginx: use [this instruction](http://davidwalsh.name/cdn-fonts).

### Setup

Put your font files (woff, woff2, ttf, otf, eot, svg) to the `public/fonts` directory. You may separate them by subdirectories.
You can convert webfont files using [Transfonter](http://transfonter.org).

All settings go to the file `config/settings-local.php`.
If you don't have it, copy it from the file `config/settings-local.php.example`.

Parameters:

#### `displayErrorDetails`

Whether errors details should be sent to browser. Anyway errors are written to the file `logs/app.log`.
**You should turn it off on production server.**

#### `logger`/`level`

How many messages should be logged to the file.
The value is one of the [`\Psr\Log\LogLevel`](http://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-3-logger-interface.md#5-psrlogloglevel) constants.
You can read more about log levels [here](http://github.com/apix/log#log-levels).

#### `fonts`

The list of fonts available in the repository. Simple example:

```php
return [
    // ...
    'fonts' => [
        'Open Sans' => [
            'styles' => [
                '300' => 'OpenSans/opensans-light.*',
                '300i' => 'OpenSans/opensans-light-italic.*',
                '400' => 'OpenSans/opensans-regular.*',
                '400i' => 'OpenSans/opensans-regular-italic.*',
            ]
        ],
        'Roboto' => [
            'styles' => [
                '300' => 'Roboto/roboto-light.*',
                '400' => 'Roboto/roboto-regular.*',
                '500' => 'Roboto/roboto-medium.*',
                '700' => 'Roboto/roboto-bold.*',
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

The `fonts` array keys are the font families names. The `styles` arrays keys are the styles names.
The numbers in the style names are the font weights, `i` stands for italic.

The font file paths are given relative to the `public/fonts` directory. 
The file paths are the [glob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) search patterns.
It means that the repository should consider all files matching the pattern as font files.

You can find more examples and possibilities [here](docs/fonts-setup.md).

### Usage

Add a `<link>` tag to the HTML code of the page on which you want to embed a font:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://web-fonts-repository.local/css?family=Open+Sans:400,400i,700,700i|Roboto:300,400" />
```

Where `http://web-fonts-repository.local` is the root URL of an installed web fonts repository.

The required fonts are specified the same way as on Google Fonts. Font families are divided by `|`, families styles
are divided by `,`, family name is separated from styles list using `:`.

You may omit the styles list. In this case the regular style (`400`) is used.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://web-fonts-repository.local/css?family=Open+Sans" />
```

Then embed a font in a CSS code:

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}
```
